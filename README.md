# Softuni-AngularWorkshop-FurnitureSystem

This is the finished Angular workshop for "Furniture system" from Softuni's Angular course 2019.

It has three projects: two clients and a server:

- The first client is written in Angular 20.
- The second client is written in React 19 via Vite and it is a visual and functional clone of the Angular client.
- The server is rewritten in .NET 9 (WebAPI), with the help of Moravian Star. The database is MS SQL.
